I’ve changed my mind about myself. I had all these assumptions baked in about who I’m supposed to be in life and I never really tried to figure em out until I took this class. I spent six years working in computers before going back to school, and before that I spent four years studying computers for a computer science degree. Hell, with all that computerin’ I became damn near sure I was just a computer.

Well I ain’t one. It turns out I feel too. I didn’t realize how much I like being outside until I thought back to the Canadian sky and canoeing twenty miles a day in camp. How those moments that came to me when looking down the barrel of a prompt were the ones where I took a risk, like my first kiss, or when I took a chance on a roadside bar in Wilcox Arizona and it backfired. When my time’s up and my life flashes before my eyes I know it’s going to be like that, playing all of those moments, and I know I need to spend my time now creating em.

I see the world differently after this class. I really do. I see myself differently. I see my family differently. I see a good book differently and when I’m reading The Grapes of Wrath I not only see Tom Joad I see Steinbeck writing Tom Joad. I’m not just a robot. No, I’m much more than that.
