Jan would have wanted to have died under the setting sun of San Francisco, amidst the hillocks and the distant sound of the crashing Pacific waves.

She was a friend and a co-conspirator whose purpose was to help others realize theirs, her character indelibly etched in many souls, more than just a car, more than just a two thousand and four Toyota Sienna, a life companion, a chariot.

She will be buried a long way from Central Maine, where she ferried college kids on their trips to the local Walmart to buy cases of Natural Light and Milwaukee’s Best, and waited in the dark while someone flashed a poorly made fake ID.

She made it two thirds of the way across the United States, to Alamogordo, New Mexico, before she needed love from a repair shop, and Keith and Dan took that time to run through seven more games of Chinese Checkers.

Dan doubted her once when he asked “Do you think she can handle it?” as they approached the steep incline of one way switchbacks leading to the top of Canyonland National Park. But she defied him, seemingly with glee, scrambling up the cracked dirt road, at times with two wheels in the air, floating above the canyon. The only sounds that could be heard were her engine whirring and Dan repeatedly asking the driver Keith, “How are you doing?”

Her spirit now returns to the heavens and her body, undoubtedly, will be morphed into the sustainable technology that will preserve the Earth: her final act, harnessing the energy of the sun and wind so that our future generations can prosper.
