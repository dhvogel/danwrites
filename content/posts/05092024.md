It was one of those summer days. The beach murmurs played with the staccato seagulls and the hourly melodic jangle of the ice cream truck. The days I would think about in Ms. Pierce's class that would cause me to fidget by fwopping my blue laminate multiplication table back and forth. She'd patiently tell me to put it down but I knew that the fwops wore on her because at the end of the year, she retired and moved to Japan.

And there I was, playing wide receiver in a two versus two game of football with three boys I had never met. I had a way of seeing a ball tossed, batted, or kicked and going to the recipient to ask, "Can I play?". In this case it was a Vortex football whose shrill whistle played a whole scale as you threw it, adding to the summer symphony.

"Sure" they would say. And I would spend the next hour proving without a shred of doubt that their gamble on me was worth it. So at fourth and a mile with the game and my reputation on the line, the Vortex twirled through the air, shrieking, sure to clear my head by twenty feet, until I jump and by some miracle cradle the nose in my right fingertips, before I crash down to the Earth, dragging one foot in bounds, on the sand that borders the Marram grass.

I hold the Vortex up and yell "I got it!" and my teammate sprints towards me. Rising to celebrate, I feel a dull pain in the bottom of my left foot, so I angle my head to look, and I see my left sole covered in a black granular gunk created from a mixture of the coarse sand and congealed blood. This is one of two times in my thirty year life I completely lose all faculty due to panic. I faint into the arms of my teammate and the other two grab a leg each, and they carry me back to my dad whose white shirt is stained red forever when he carries his now-hysterical son back to the car.

I never saw the three boys again.
