[{"content":" It was one of those summer days. The beach murmurs played with the staccato seagulls and the hourly melodic jangle of the ice cream truck. The days I would think about in Ms. Pierce\u0026rsquo;s class that would cause me to fidget by fwopping my blue laminate multiplication table back and forth. She\u0026rsquo;d patiently tell me to put it down but I knew that the fwops wore on her because at the end of the year, she retired and moved to Japan.\nAnd there I was, playing wide receiver in a two versus two game of football with three boys I had never met. I had a way of seeing a ball tossed, batted, or kicked and going to the recipient to ask, \u0026ldquo;Can I play?\u0026rdquo;. In this case it was a Vortex football whose shrill whistle played a whole scale as you threw it, adding to the summer symphony.\n\u0026ldquo;Sure\u0026rdquo; they would say. And I would spend the next hour proving without a shred of doubt that their gamble on me was worth it. So at fourth and a mile with the game and my reputation on the line, the Vortex twirled through the air, shrieking louder, looking sure to clear my head by twenty feet, until I jump up and by some miracle cradle the nose in my right fingertips, before I come crashing down to the Earth, but not before I drag one foot in bounds, on the sand that borders the Marram grass.\nI hold the Vortex up and yell \u0026ldquo;I got it!\u0026rdquo; and I see my teammate sprinting towards me. Rising to celebrate, in the bottom of my left foot I feel a dull pain, so I angle my head to take a look, and I see my left sole covered in black cement, a mixture of sand and congealed blood. This is one of two times in my thirty year life I have a complete loss of faculty due to panic. I faint into the arms of my teammate and the other two grab a leg each, and they carry me back to my dad whose white shirt is stained red forever when he carries his now-hysterical son back to the car.\nI never saw the three boys again.\n","permalink":"https://dansramblings.com/posts/05092024/","summary":"It was one of those summer days.

In fact when he was seventeen an article in the Oklahoman caused him to hitch rides for twenty days to Topeka just to see that new capitol building. The thing was, he couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but see Paul as a kid, and he knew for a fact that all kids are dumb. But it wasn’t about that.\n“What’s a matter with the farm? You don’ like it?” Tom asked.\n“Well I like parts of it.” Paul stopped and then he started again, “I like a tractorin’ an’ a mowin’ the fields with Pete.” He paused again, “But I don’ know if this life is for me.”\nThe truth was, for his whole life Paul had assumed that he was just the next generation of farmer. They had the land now that, when his dad was growing up, he would have killed for.\nThere was silence for a few more seconds until Tom broke it.\n“Ok.”\n“Ok?”\n“Yep, Ok. Go on and make ya mistakes. Jes’ write ever’ so ofen an let me know yer still alive.”\nPaul nodded his head and only later when he was walking away did he grin.\n","permalink":"https://dansramblings.com/posts/story1/","summary":"“Stick aroun’,” said Tom. “Stick aroun’ till tomorra anyways.”\nThe boy paused. “No. I’m a-goin’”, he said. “I got my min’ made up.

Dan, that’s fuckin’ terrible.”\nChuck swished his way downstream to me and held out his hand, in which I put the Orvis fly-fishing rod. A gentle wind swayed the branches of the red Vermont Maples lining the stream.\n“Too much wrist. You want your whole upper body involved. Like this”, Chuck cast the fly out and let it drift, dangling the brown squirrel-hair lure in front of the rock crags where the rainbow trout were spawning.\n“Just like that. You don’t got to hammer it, Jesus Christ, you just got to throw it like a baseball. Here.”\nHe put the rod back in my hand, turned, and swished back to Grant to continue telling him about his favorite fish. Grant, who fished for years growing up, had a lot to say about kinds of fish, their weight, and their length. Me being a first timer, I had little to offer. But that was all about to change, once I caught my trophy rainbow trout, which I could just feel swimming on the other side of the stream.\nI cast one more time and let it drift. And then, a tug. The bob dove underneath the surface and I pulled up hard. I ripped the line in my right hand before tugging the rod back again with my left. And I felt the fish fight, swimming hard in the opposite direction. And I pulled again, line still taught, and again, until, all of a sudden, the line went slack. The bob resurfaced and continued to drift downstream.\n“I almost had one!” I shouted up at Grant and Chuck.\nChuck yelled back, “Probably just a rock!”\n","permalink":"https://dansramblings.com/posts/story2/","summary":"“Great job, Grant.

I had all these assumptions baked in about who I’m supposed to be in life and I never really tried to figure em out until I took this class. I spent six years working in computers before going back to school, and before that I spent four years studying computers for a computer science degree. Hell, with all that computerin’ I became damn near sure I was just a computer.\nWell I ain’t one. It turns out I feel too. I didn’t realize how much I like being outside until I thought back to the Canadian sky and canoeing twenty miles a day in camp. How those moments that came to me when looking down the barrel of a prompt were the ones where I took a risk, like my first kiss, or when I took a chance on a roadside bar in Wilcox Arizona and it backfired. When my time’s up and my life flashes before my eyes I know it’s going to be like that, playing all of those moments, and I know I need to spend my time now creating em.\nI see the world differently after this class. I really do. I see myself differently. I see my family differently. I see a good book differently and when I’m reading The Grapes of Wrath I not only see Tom Joad I see Steinbeck writing Tom Joad. I’m not just a robot. No, I’m much more than that.\n","permalink":"https://dansramblings.com/posts/story3/","summary":"I’ve changed my mind about myself.
